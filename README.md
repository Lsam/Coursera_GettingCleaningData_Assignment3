Data was downloaded manually, and unzipped in the working directory

## Step 2.
The following operations on the data have been performed :

### importing all the relevant data into a proper structure (I chose a list of all the table I will be using)
* "test/X_test.txt" -> all the 561 variables for the 2947 observations of the test DS
* "test/y_test.txt" -> the 2947 values of the activity code number
* "test/subject_test.txt" -> the 2947 values of the subject code number
* "train/X_train.txt"  -> all the 561 variables for the 7352 observations of the train DS
* "train/y_train.txt" -> the 7352 values of the activity code number
* "train/subject_train.txt" -> the 7352 values of the subject code number
* "features.txt" -> the features, aka the 561 variables names studied
* "activity_labels.txt" -> the 6 activities, with code and name

### renaming the colname for X_test and X_train values

### merging each test and train data with both activities and subject
